# CAR-RENTAL-SYSTEM
The Car Rental System is a C++ program designed to manage a simple car rental service. The system allows both buyers and sellers to interact with the database, facilitating the rental and addition of cars. The program is integrated with a MySQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

*	Front-end Implementation:
In the front-end design phase, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was crafted using C++ to ensure an intuitive user experience. The layout focused on user-friendly navigation within the Car Rental System.

*	Back-end Implementation:
The back-end implementation secured a connection to the MySQL database, facilitating reliable data exchange. SQL queries were strategically employed for CRUD operations, handling data creation, retrieval, updates, and deletions
